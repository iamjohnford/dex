<p>Dear {{ user.username }},</p>
<h3>Multi Lists is Live!</h3>
<p>Told you I wouldn't be long ;) Multi lists is now live, with the following features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Custom named lists</b> - You can add as many custom named lists as you wish to track. Each one can be colour coded to make them easier to spot in the list.</li>
    <li><b>Forms</b> - You can select which forms you do or don't want on a per list basis</li>
    <li><b>URL parameter</b> - Lists have been added to the URL query parameters to make sharing directly easier</li>
</ul>

<p>Upcoming additions to this function include:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Inclusive or Exclusive</b> - You will be able to pick between inclusive lists, which will only show the specific ones you want, or exclusive which will show all except ones you want to hide.</li>
    <li><b>Default filters</b> - The list will load with default filter set so you can show it exactly how you want your friends to view it!</li>
    <li><b>Default list</b> - You will be able to pick a default list which is the one that shows when your profile loads without one selected</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other features in this release</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Mobile "Add to desktop"</b> - for a more native feel pin the website to your home screen to have it behave like a native app</li>
</ul>

<h3>Upcoming features</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Search strings for Pokemon GO</b> - you will be able to export a search string for a set of results, so for example you can select "shinys" and "not owned", export the list and send it to a friend, who can then paste it into Pokemon GO and see instantly if they have what you need!</li>
    <li><b>Pokedex features</b> - I am gathering more data to improve these panels, first up is evolution data and candy details</li>
</ul>
