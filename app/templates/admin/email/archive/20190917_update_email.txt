Dear {{ user.username }},


** HOSTING MOVE
------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, apologies for the downtime over the last few days, the costs on my AWS account exploded and I was suddenly in need of finding a new hosting provider. I have now completed the move to Google Cloud, so things should be a bit more stable going forward.

Â 
** NEW FEATURES & A NEW GEN!
------------------------------------------------------------

This update comes with the release of Gen 5, and the app has been updated with all the new pokemon. It'll be nice to see some shadows again!

On top of that, I have added a couple of new features:

 	* Shadow & Purified - Thanks to th1rtyf0ur you can now track shadow and purified pokemon
 	* Gender Filter - You can now filter by male, female and ungendered
 	* Armoured Mewtwo - Armoured Mewtwo is now available, and is affected by the 'Costumed' filter.

Now we are on a new hosting provider and the costs have been kept down, the future looks brighter for DEX.

Thanks for using the app and happy catching!

Sincerely,

The Dex Team
