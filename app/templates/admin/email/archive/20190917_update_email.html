<p>Dear {{ user.username }},</p>
<h3>Hosting Move</h3>
<p>First of all, apologies for the downtime over the last few days, the costs on my AWS account exploded and I was suddenly in need of finding a new hosting provider. I have now completed the move to Google Cloud, so things should be a bit more stable going forward.</p>
<h3>New Features & A New Gen!</h3>
<p>This update comes with the release of Gen 5, and the app has been updated with all the new pokemon. It'll be nice to see some shadows again!</p>
<p>On top of that, I have added a couple of new features:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Shadow & Purified</b> - Thanks to th1rtyf0ur you can now track shadow and purified pokemon.</li>
    <li><b>Gender Filter</b> - You can now filter by male, female and ungendered.</li>
    <li><b>Armoured Mewtwo</b> - Armoured Mewtwo is now available, and is affected by the 'Costumed' filter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now we are on a new hosting provider and the costs have been kept down, the future looks brighter for DEX.</p>
<p>Thanks for using the app and happy catching!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Dex Team</p>
